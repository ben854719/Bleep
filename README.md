Summary:

The project is call Bleep from the department of Re-education (Codecademy). I will show you the use of the computer language C++ to build an algorithm that can bleep out any words deemed unsavory by the department of re-education. I will write a bleep.cpp program that “bleeps” any words that passed in the program. I will assess the word "broccoli" which has been banned by the department.

Computer skill: C++
